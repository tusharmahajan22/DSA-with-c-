## Introduction

Understanding data structures and algorithms is essential for writing efficient and optimized code. This repository is designed to provide clear explanations of various data structures, algorithms, and their implementations in C++. Whether it's sorting algorithms, searching techniques, linked lists, trees, or graphs, you'll find detailed explanations and corresponding code samples.

## Getting Started

To get started with the content in this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Start by cloning this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```bash
   https://github.com/tusharmahajan22/dsa-with-c.git
   ```

2. **Install Visual Studio Code:** If you haven't already, install Visual Studio Code on your machine. You can download it from the official [Visual Studio Code website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
